# slquickemu
A rust program for launching qemu from portable config files.

## Idea
This program is based on the quickemu by Martin Wimpress. 
I wanted/needed to add a ton of options to the program, and 
I don't know bash well enough for it to make sense for me to use that.
I also wanted to learn some rust. Hence this project.

Hopefully it is a cleaned up port of my python version.
